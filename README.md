# Detector probe to identify noisy LED lights

It is made of a simple application circuit of the AD8307 log detector. I found it quite effective to detect RF radiating LED lights or other sources of spurious RF.

Schematic is in LTSpice (and pdf), includes a home made spice model of the AD8307 (incomplete: INT pin somehow works, OFS not connected). AD8310 spice model is the one from ADI

For this photo a (bad) led light was more than one meter away.
